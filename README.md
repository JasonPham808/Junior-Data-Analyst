## Portfolio Projects
### 1. Play Quest Conquer (PQC) Consulting Project

**Description:** This project provided strategic consulting for Play Quest Conquer (PQC), an online gaming platform, to determine the key factors influencing game ratings. Leveraging a multiple linear regression model, the analysis identified essential features like Average Complexity, High-Interest Number, and Game Type as significant predictors of game ratings. The findings aimed to guide PQC’s game development, acquisition, and marketing strategies by offering insights into user preferences and game performance.

**Code File:** Python code was used for data preprocessing, transformation, and multiple regression analysis. Additional models, such as Random Forest regression, were implemented to explore non-linear relationships, enhancing prediction accuracy for Average Ratings. 

**Presentation:** A visual presentation delivered an overview of the analytical approach, data insights, and model performance, highlighting factors that most significantly impact game ratings. Visuals included correlation matrices, regression scatter plots, and feature importance metrics from machine learning models.

**Skills:**
Hard Skills: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, multiple linear regression, Random Forest modeling, performance evaluation using MSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics, and multicollinearity assessment with VIF.
Soft Skills: Strategic communication of technical findings, collaboration with stakeholders, and translating data insights into actionable recommendations for business impact.

**Result:** The linear regression model provided moderate explanatory power (R² of 0.20), identifying complexity and playtime as key drivers of positive game ratings. Advanced models like Random Forest showed potential for better predictive performance, suggesting that non-linear approaches could enhance accuracy further. Recommendations included focusing on complex, engaging games and targeted marketing for high-interest games to boost engagement and satisfaction.

**Recognition:** The project adhered to Deakin University’s consulting standards, showcasing the application of advanced analytics and data-driven strategies to support PQC's business goals effectively.
